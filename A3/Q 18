Q18.

// This program finds the average time spent programming by a student
// each day over a three day period.

#include <iostream>

	int numStudents;
	float numHours, total, average;
	int student, day = 0;	// these are the counters for the loops
  int n {};

				 << student << " on day " << day << "." << endl;

			total = total + numHours;

		average = total / 3;

}
Note that the inner loop of this program is always executed exactly three timesâ€”once for each day of the long weekend. 
Modify the code so that the inner loop iterates n times, where n is a positive integer input by the user. In other words, 
let the user decide how many days to consider just as they choose how many students to consider.

Sample Run:

This program will find the average number of hours a day that a student spent programming over a long weekend

How many students are there?
2
Enter the number of days in the long weekend
2

Please enter the number of hours worked by student 1 on day 1
4

Please enter the number of hours worked by student 1 on day 2
6

The average number of hours per day spent programming by student 1 is 5


Please enter the number of hours worked by student 2 on day 1
9

Please enter the number of hours worked by student 2 on day 2
13

The average number of hours per day spent programming by student 2 is 11
