Q7. Write a program that asks the user for the name of a file, and an integer number. The program should display 
the first several lines of the file on the screen, and the number of lines should be equal to the integer entered 
by the user. If the number of lines the file has is less than the integer entered by the user, then the entire file 
should be displayed, with a message indicating the entire file has been displayed.

When evaluating the peer submissions, please consider two cases to verify the program, with one case where the file
has enough lines, and one case where the file does not have enough lines.
