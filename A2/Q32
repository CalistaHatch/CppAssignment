Q32. Write a C++ program to enable the conversion between US dollars and Canadian Dollars. The program will first ask for user input to decide whether the user would like to convert USD to CAD, or the other way around. Then the program will ask for user input to indicate the amount of money in the original currency, and then output the converted amount in the targeted currency.

Examples:Please enter 0 to indicate USD->CAD conversion, or enter 1 to indicate CAD->USD conversion: 0
Please enter the amount of USD dollars: XXX
They can be converted to YYY CAD.
Please enter 0 to indicate USD->CAD conversion, or enter 1 to indicate CAD->USD conversion: 1
Please enter the amount of CAD dollars: XXX
They can be converted to YYY USD.

Here XXX represent the numerical input from user, and YYY represent the calculated numerical value by the program. You can assume 1 United States Dollar equals 1.32 Canadian Dollar in this question.
